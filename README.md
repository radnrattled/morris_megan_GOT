##Megan GOT Video project

##The Plan: 
1. Gather the information and images for the last two houses
2. Use the code already written to add those to the array
3. Animate the banner
	-I know the "let offsetvalue" is setting the pixel value at which the banner will slide (600px over showing the next picture) and the target value is calling on a data set. Figure out how to call the houseImgaes div into the function.
4. Animate the banner before the video plays. For this I reasearched Call stacks, call backs and how to manipulate them using setTimeout. Resource: https://codeburst.io/javascript-what-the-heck-is-a-callback-aba4da2deced
